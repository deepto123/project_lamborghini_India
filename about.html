    <p>Italian super sports car maker Lamborghini will end the year 2020 with a decline in India volumes for the first time in
    seven years. But that is not deterring it from launching new models here. Albeit with some delay, the maker of Urus and
    other brands plans to bring in a flurry of new models including Huracan STO, Huracan EVO RWD Spyder starting from the
    second quarter of next calendar. <br><br><br>

    Sharad Agarwal, head Lamborghini India says the company is seeing a gradual but steady recovery and the run rate is
    reaching the pre-Covid level for the new orders. Agarwal expects the overall super luxury car segment to end the current
    year with a 30 per cent decline, but that for his company to be narrower. A niche market for sports cars, a total of 270
    cars were sold in India in 2019. <br><br><br>
    
    “The 2020 volumes are not as per the plan as there were demand as well as supply side challenges. But we expect 2021,”
    said Agarwal. This segment is driven by emotions. <br><br><br>
    
    “Nobody wanted to be seen owning and enjoying a luxury sports car,” he added pointing out that though the year started
    off on a strong night, demand fizzled out after the pandemic. Additionally, with factories being shuttered globally,
    there were also supply side challenges.</p><br><br><br>
